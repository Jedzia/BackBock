This Editor is from SharpDevelop, 
but the SharpDevelop Licence is LGPL, 
so i excluded it in a own Library,
because LGPL is not compatible with MS-PL

There are no big changes done to the Files,
most are copied from Sharp Develop Directly.

The Classes in notFromSharpDevelop are neccesarry,
so that it compiles!
